               <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
               <p>GRV Media launched The Focus in March 2020 to provide a platform for furloughed and out-of-work journalists during the covid-19 pandemic.</p>

               <p>The project has grown into much more than that. As the world emerges from lock-down into a climate of uncertainty, it’s clear many internships and junior journalist roles have disappeared.</p>

               <p>Established journalists may feel isolated and undervalued while an entire generation of young, ambitious writers could be left with few opportunities to gain valuable experience and start a career.</p>
               <h3>WRITERS’ ACADEMY</h3>

               <span>The Focus Writers’ Academy – Paid Opportunities</span>
               
               <p>For young journalists, students and graduates, The Focus has a limited number of opportunities through our Paid Writers’ Academy. Our editors provide feedback on style while giving writers tips on best use of Google Trends, SEO and other writing tools. Our editors aim to equip inexperienced writers with tools that will stand them in good stead for their career while building a portfolio of work.</p>

               <p>Many members of our first cohort have gone on to gain freelance or full-time work with GRV Media or other companies within the industry.</p>

               <p>The Paid Writers’ Academy is currently closed to applications but please keep an eye out for future announcements. Alternatively, email paul.watson@grv.media with your CV, a cover letter and links to published articles online.</p>
